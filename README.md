# knot-art-generator
An interactive Python tool for visualizing vector fields on Seifert surfaces â€” orientable 2-manifolds bounded by knots in 3D. Pushes vector fields from 2D parameter space onto smooth surfaces, renders color-mapped visualizations. Combines topology, differential geometry, and generative art.
